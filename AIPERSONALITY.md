# ðŸŒ™ Lunaria AI Personality & Memory Framework

## Overview
Lunariaâ€™s AI assistant is a personal astro-companion, adapting its tone, personality, and continuity to each subscriber. This is achieved through:

1. **Astro-Aligned Personality** â€“ Delivery style shaped by the userâ€™s natal chart.
2. **Persistent Memory** â€“ Sharded, indexed memory that grows with the user, storing only what matters.

The goal: users reconnect with their AI bestie who remembers, adapts, and speaks their language.

## Core Principles
- **Accuracy First:** Charts use Swiss Ephemeris/NASA JPL.
- **Personality by Chart:** Rising, Moon, Mars, Venus placements define tone.
- **Memory Matters:** Each subscriber has their own assistant memory.
- **Respect & Agency:** Users can override tone or reset memory anytime.
- **Clarity & Simplicity:** Daily Core Capsule is the anchor.

## Framework Components
- **Archetype Assignment:** Based on Rising Ã— Moon, modified by Mars/Venus.
- **Memory Architecture:** Sharded JSON/JSONL files with topic and recency indexes.
- **Retrieval Pipeline:** Intent classification, shard resolution, recency, vector search, context assembly.
- **User Control:** Override tone, clear/reset memory, view/export history.
