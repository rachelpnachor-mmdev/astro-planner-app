# üìñ README ‚Äì MVP (Free Tier)

## Overview

The MVP delivers a **single in-app daily view** (equivalent to ‚ÄúPage 1 in print‚Äù) plus a **1-page PDF export**.

* **Included**: onboarding to collect **birth data**, daily **transit summary**, **upcoming events**, **focus of the day**, and **task list**.
* **Excluded in MVP**: Creative Flow (requires goals), Pages 2‚Äì4 (rituals, chores/kitchen, reflection), premium print service, and paid modules.

## User Flow

1. User opens app ‚Üí prompted for **birth date & time** (with ‚Äúunknown time‚Äù option) and **birth place**.
2. Profile is saved locally.
3. App generates **Today** (transit summary, events, focus, tasks).
4. User can switch between **Today / This Week / This Month**.
5. User can **export Today** as a 1-page PDF.

## User Stories (BDD)

### Onboarding

**Scenario: prompt for birth data**
**Given** I am a new user,
**And** I open the app for the first time,
**When** the app loads,
**Then** I should be asked to enter my **birth date** and **birth time**.

**Scenario: unknown birth time**
**Given** I don‚Äôt know my exact birth time,
**When** I toggle ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù
**Then** the app should default to a **solar chart** (12:00 PM local) with a note about reduced precision.

**Scenario: location lookup**
**Given** I start typing my birth city,
**When** I select a suggestion,
**Then** the app stores latitude/longitude and timezone for chart calculation.

**Scenario: save profile data**
**Given** I have entered my birth date, time, and place,
**When** I tap ‚ÄúSave,‚Äù
**Then** my profile should be stored locally,
**And** the app should use this profile to generate my daily view.

### Daily View (Page 1 in-app)

**Scenario: see personalized day**
**Given** my profile is saved,
**When** I open the app on a given day,
**Then** I should see:

* Transit summary (bullets)
* Upcoming events (Morning / AM window / All day / Background)
* Focus of the day (Do‚Äôs, Don‚Äôts, Opportunities, Warnings)
* Task list (3‚Äì5 practical actions)
  **And** the header shows Date (L), Moon emoji + phase (C), Day planet (R).
  **And** the footer shows *‚ú¶ As above, so below ‚ú¶* in gray italic.

**Scenario: graceful missing data**
**Given** some fields are empty,
**When** the daily view renders,
**Then** missing sections are **skipped gracefully** without layout errors.

### Switch Views

**Scenario: switch to weekly view**
**Given** I am on the daily view,
**When** I tap ‚ÄúThis Week,‚Äù
**Then** I should see a **weekly transit summary** and **weekly upcoming events**.

**Scenario: switch to monthly view**
**Given** I am on the daily view,
**When** I tap ‚ÄúThis Month,‚Äù
**Then** I should see a **monthly transit summary** and **monthly upcoming events**.

### PDF Export

**Scenario: export the daily page**
**Given** I am viewing today‚Äôs page,
**When** I tap **Export PDF**,
**Then** I get a **1-page PDF** with the same sections and header/footer styling as in-app.

## Requirements

### Functional

* Onboarding form: birth date, time (with ‚Äúunknown‚Äù toggle), place (autocomplete).
* Save minimal profile locally.
* Generate **Daily JSON** (via stubbed astro logic).
* Render in-app **Daily View** with Page 1 sections (no Creative Flow).
* Switch between **Today / This Week / This Month** for transit summary + upcoming events.
* Export a **1-page PDF** of Today.

### Non-Functional

* PDF: Letter 8.5√ó11, ~0.5" margins, printer-friendly.
* Fonts: **DejaVuSans** (regular/bold/italic) + **Symbola** (moon emoji).
* Accessibility: ‚â•12pt body text in PDF, scalable text in app.
* Handle missing data gracefully.

## Data Contracts

### Profile (local)

```json
{
  "profile": {
    "birth_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "birth_time": "HH:MM",
    "birth_time_unknown": true,
    "birth_place": "City, Country",
    "birth_lat": 0.0,
    "birth_lng": 0.0,
    "birth_tz": "Region/City"
  }
}
```

### Daily JSON (MVP Page 1 only)

```json
{
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD (Weekday)",
  "moon_phase_sign": "Waxing/Waning/New/Full in <Sign>",
  "day_planet": "Planet (Weekday)",
  "horoscope": {
    "transit_summary": ["‚Ä¶"],
