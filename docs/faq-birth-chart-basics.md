# Birth Chart Basics FAQ

## What is a birth chart?
A birth chart (also called a natal chart) is a map of where all the planets were positioned at the exact moment and location of your birth. It's like a cosmic snapshot that astrologers believe influences your personality, strengths, challenges, and life path.

## What information do I need to create my birth chart?
You need three essential pieces of information:
- **Birth date** (month, day, year)
- **Birth time** (as exact as possible - hour and minute)
- **Birth location** (city, state/province, country)

## Why is birth time so important?
Your birth time determines:
- The position of your houses (life areas)
- Your Ascendant/Rising sign (how others see you)
- Your Midheaven (career and reputation)
- Exact planetary positions and aspects

Even being off by a few minutes can change your Ascendant or house placements.

## What if I don't know my exact birth time?
- Check your birth certificate (most accurate)
- Ask family members who were present
- Contact the hospital where you were born
- If unavailable, you can create a chart for noon, but house positions won't be accurate

## What are the 12 houses in astrology?
The houses represent different life areas:

## What do the planets represent?

## What are the zodiac signs?
The 12 zodiac signs describe how planetary energies are expressed:
- **Fire signs** (Aries, Leo, Sagittarius): Dynamic, enthusiastic, spontaneous
- **Earth signs** (Taurus, Virgo, Capricorn): Practical, stable, material-focused
- **Air signs** (Gemini, Libra, Aquarius): Mental, social, communicative
- **Water signs** (Cancer, Scorpio, Pisces): Emotional, intuitive, sensitive

## How do I read my birth chart?
1. Start with your "Big Three": Sun, Moon, and Ascendant signs
2. Look at which houses your planets occupy
3. Notice any patterns or concentrations of planets
4. Consider aspects (angles) between planets
5. Remember: astrology is symbolic and interpretive, not deterministic

## What's the difference between your Sun sign and Ascendant?
- **Sun sign**: Your core identity (what most people know as "their sign")
- **Ascendant/Rising**: How you appear to others, your social mask
- **Moon sign**: Your emotional nature and inner self

All three are equally important for understanding your personality.
