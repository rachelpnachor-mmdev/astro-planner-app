# Setup and Troubleshooting FAQ

## How do I enter my birth information correctly?

### Birth Date
- Use the format shown in your region (MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY)
- Double-check the year - this is a common source of errors
- For births before 1900 or after 2100, contact support

### Birth Time
- Enter in 24-hour format (14:30) or 12-hour with AM/PM (2:30 PM)
- Be as precise as possible - even 4 minutes can change your Rising sign
- Use your birth certificate if available (most accurate)
- Hospital records are more reliable than family memory

### Birth Location
- **Type the city name** and select from the dropdown
- If your city doesn't appear, try:
  - The nearest major city
  - The state/province name
  - Different spelling variations
- For births outside major cities, use the closest available location

## What if my city isn't in the location database?

### Solutions
1. **Try variations**: "St. Louis" vs "Saint Louis"
2. **Use the state/province**: For small towns, enter just the state
3. **Nearest major city**: Select the closest large city (within 50 miles)
4. **Contact support**: We can add missing locations to our database

### Geographic Accuracy
- **Within 50 miles**: Usually no significant difference
- **Different time zones**: Will affect planetary positions
- **Different countries**: May require manual coordinate entry

## Timezone Issues

### Common Problems
- **Daylight Saving Time**: The app automatically adjusts for historical DST
- **Time zone changes**: Historical changes are included in calculations
- **Multiple time zones**: Some locations have changed zones over time

### If your chart looks wrong:
1. Verify you selected the correct location
2. Check if the time zone shown matches your expectation
3. Remember that time zones have changed historically

## Why don't my planets match other astrology apps?

### Different Calculation Methods
- **Tropical vs Sidereal**: About 24Â° difference
- **House systems**: Planets may appear in different houses
- **Ayanamsa**: Different calculations for sidereal charts
- **Ephemeris data**: Most apps use Swiss Ephemeris (same as us)

### Settings to Check
1. **Zodiac type**: Tropical (Western) vs Sidereal (Vedic)
2. **House system**: Placidus vs Whole Sign vs Equal House
3. **Birth time accuracy**: Even 4 minutes can matter

## My Rising sign is different from other sources

### Common Causes
1. **Birth time error**: Most likely cause - check your birth certificate
2. **Location error**: Wrong city or coordinates
3. **Time zone confusion**: Historical changes affect calculations
4. **Rounding differences**: Some apps round to nearest sign

### To verify:
- Use your official birth certificate time
- Confirm the exact location (hospital, city)
- Try calculating for a time 15 minutes before/after

## The app says I need more accurate birth information

### Why This Happens
- Birth time affects house positions and Rising sign
- Some planetary aspects are time-sensitive
- The app needs precision for accurate calculations

### Solutions
1. **Check birth certificate**: Most reliable source
2. **Contact birth hospital**: They may have records
3. **Ask family members**: Who was present at birth?
4. **Birth time rectification**: Advanced technique (consult professional astrologer)

## My chart disappeared or won't save

### Troubleshooting Steps
1. **Check your internet connection**: Charts sync to cloud storage
2. **Restart the app**: Force close and reopen
3. **Update the app**: Ensure you have the latest version
4. **Clear app cache**: In device settings (Android) or reinstall (iOS)

### Data Backup
- Your birth information is saved to your account
- Charts are automatically backed up when connected to internet
- Profile changes sync across devices

## The chart wheel looks wrong or distorted

### Display Issues
1. **Zoom out**: Double-tap to reset zoom level
2. **Restart app**: Close and reopen the application
3. **Device orientation**: Try rotating your device
4. **Update app**: Graphics improvements in newer versions

### Chart Layout
- ASC should always appear at 9 o'clock position
- MC should always appear at 12 o'clock position
- If these are wrong, contact support

## App crashes when I try to create a chart

### Common Solutions
1. **Restart your device**: Clear memory and processes
2. **Update the app**: Bug fixes in newer versions
3. **Check device storage**: Ensure adequate free space
4. **Close other apps**: Free up memory
5. **Reinstall app**: Last resort - you won't lose saved data
